# Postprocessing Utilities

This directory packages some useful Python tools for dealing with the domain-decomposed data generated by the sample problems in this repository. To use them, they must be installed locally as a package by executing the following command in **this** directory:
```
pip install -e .
```
Thereafter, specific functions can be imported from the ```pschwarz``` package, e.g.,
```
from pschwarz.data_utils import load_field_data
from pschwarz.vis_utils import plot_contours
```

Examples of using these utilities can be found in the running directories of the sample case executables. For example,
```
build/tests_cpp/eigen_2d_swe_slip_wall_implicit_schwarz/firstorder/plot.py
```
plots the monolithic and Schwarz SWE height fields side-by-side over time, and can be easily modified to display other state variables.
